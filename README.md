## About

This repository aims to document and share my journey in embedded systems development with Arduino. Each project within this repository will have its own dedicated folder containing the necessary code, schematics, and detailed instructions.

## Projects

Currently, the repository includes the following project:

- [Traffic Light System](/traffic-light-system/README.md): A basic traffic light control system demonstrating fundamental digital output and timing concepts.

More projects will be added as they are developed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you will need:

- An **Arduino Uno** board (or compatible).
- The **Arduino IDE** installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of electronics and C/C++ programming.

Each project's `README.md` file will provide specific instructions on how to set up the hardware, upload the code, and operate the project.
